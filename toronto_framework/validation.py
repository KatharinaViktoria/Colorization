"""
validation of baseline and our proposed architecture
prepare images for Turing test
"""


"""
--------------TODO---------------------------------
load both models 
	- baseline
	- new architecture

load around 100 mixed images from the testing dataset
preprocess (might have to adapte process function)

shuffle them
predict both batches using the baseline and the new architecture
plot them side by side
	- for the Turing test: in pairs 
			baseline
			new architecture
	- for the write-up: all 4
			input (l channel)
			ground truth
			baseline
			new architecture
